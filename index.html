## self_defense
### "Israel has the right to defend itself"

#### Why This Claim Is False:

<strong>Because Gaza is legally regarded as occupied territory, Israel's invocation of UN Charter Article 51 against Gaza is widely rejected by international courts and experts.</strong>  The International Court of Justice (ICJ) held in its 2004 Wall Advisory Opinion that Article 51 self‑defence is inapplicable when the alleged threat emanates from territory the same state occupies.<sup>1</sup>  UN special procedures and leading jurists continue to rely on that ruling, stressing that an occupying power must address violence under the stricter framework of occupation law, not the looser doctrine of inter‑state self‑defence. 

#### Legal Evidence:

- **ICJ, Advisory Opinion (9 July 2004)** – Para 139 concludes that Article 51 "has no relevance" because Israel "exercises control in the occupied Palestinian territory" and the attacks invoked are not attributable to another state. 
- **UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese** – "Israel cannot claim the right of self‑defence against a threat that emanates from a territory it occupies."<sup>2</sup>
- **UN Experts' Joint Statement (16 Nov 2023)** – Warned that Israel's self‑defence narrative is "legally unfounded" because Gaza "remains under belligerent occupation."<sup>3</sup>
- **John Quigley (Ohio State Univ.)** – Occupying powers "fall under the law of belligerent occupation, not Article 51"; Israel therefore lacks a self‑defence claim in Gaza.<sup>4</sup>

<strong>The Legal Framework Summarised:</strong>  
- **UN Charter Art. 51** applies only to armed attacks by another state; Gaza is not a state.  
- **ICJ 2004 Opinion** affirms that an occupier cannot invoke Art. 51 against the territory it occupies.  
- **Occupation Law (Fourth Geneva Convention)** obliges Israel to protect the population it controls, using law‑enforcement‑style force.  
- **Caroline Doctrine** standards of necessity and proportionality reinforce the above limits; large‑scale bombardment fails both tests.

## civilian_protection
### "Israel takes unprecedented measures to protect civilians"

#### Why This Claim Is Misleading:

<strong>Israel's evacuation warnings, roof‑knocks and leaflets do not offset systematic violations of distinction, proportionality, and—critically—its mass forced transfers, which international law classifies as war crimes.</strong> Neutral reporting and UN data show residents ordered from one "safe" zone to another, then bombed en‑route or at the destination, rendering the precautions void.

#### Evidence of Systematic Civilian Harm:
Many hundreds of pieces of evidence attest to established patterns in the IDF that illegally cause harm to civilians in Gaza, here are a few examples.

- <strong>Residential Destruction:</strong> Reuters satellite analysis shows <strong>≈ 60 %</strong> of Gaza's buildings—mainly homes—damaged or destroyed, confirming area‑wide bombardment rather than precision strikes.<sup>1</sup>
- <strong>Civilian Death Profile:</strong> UN rights office verifies <strong>≈ 70 %</strong> of confirmed dead are women and children<sup>2</sup>; AP audit found <strong>64 %</strong> women/minors by Oct 2023.<sup>3</sup> This proportion is extremely high compared to other conflicts, indicating a much higher willingness to kill civilians on the part of the IDF.
 
    | Conflict (period) | Verified civilian deaths^ | Women + children (%) | Source |
    |-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|--------|
    | Gaza, Israel–Hamas war (Oct 2023 – Jul 2025) | 8 119† |≈ 70 | UN OHCHR |
    | Afghanistan (Jan – Jun 2021) | 5 183 casualties‡ |46 | UNAMA |
    | Ukraine (Feb 2022 – Feb 2025) | ≈ 12 500 killed |< 20 | UN OHCHR |
    | Syria (Jan – Jun 2025) | 2 818 killed |14 | UN OHCHR |

    <div style="font-size:0.75em; line-height:1.2em; color:#999999; margin-top:20px;">  
^ Most recent period with publicly verified demographic data.<br>
† UN‑verified fatalities only; Gaza Health‑Ministry total deaths are higher.<br>
‡ UNAMA lists killed + injured; demographic shares are consistent across both.<br>
§ OHCHR reports lack a sex breakdown; even if all unidentified victims were women the combined share remains below Gaza's level.
</div>

- <strong>Scale of Displacement:</strong> UNRWA reports <strong>90 %</strong> of Gaza's 2.3 million residents uprooted—direct fallout of the evacuation policy classified above as a war crime.<sup>4</sup>
- <strong>Documented Executions of Unarmed Civilians:</strong>  
    - IDF body‑cam (3 Jul 2025) shows a soldier shooting deaf 72‑year‑old Ada Ibrahim al‑Muquait at point‑blank range while his hands were raised; the shooter confirms the victim is unarmed and is congratulated by squad mates. No record of disciplinary action against the killer has been found so far.<sup>5</sup>
    - Footage captures an elderly woman walking with her grandson who waves a white flag (12 Nov 2023); the woman is shot and killed despite the clear civilian status of the group. No record of disciplinary action against the killer has been found so far.<sup>6</sup>
    - Forensic Architecture reconstruction (29 Jan 2024) documents the killing of six‑year‑old Hind Rajab and six relatives: trapped in a car, they pleaded for rescue by phone for two hours before an Israeli tank opened sustained machine‑gun fire, killing everyone inside. The ambulance dispatched for them was then hit, killing two paramedics. No record of disciplinary action has emerged.<sup>7</sup>

<strong>Pattern and Culture:</strong> These individual atrocities—verified by video, body‑cam or forensic reconstruction—and the absence of subsequent accountability indicate an institutional culture within the IDF that tolerates or encourages the killing of civilians. The consistency of such incidents across units and time frames undermines any narrative that they are aberrations; rather, they reflect permissive rules of engagement that normalise civilian harm.

#### Analysis of Israeli Protective Measures vs. Actual Practice:

- <strong>Warnings Without Safety:</strong> ICRC deemed the first mass‑evacuation order "not compatible with international humanitarian law" because Gaza's population "has nowhere safe to go."<sup>8</sup> UNOCHA now counts <strong>≈ 82 %</strong> of the strip under active evacuation or militarised‑zone orders, many re‑issued for areas previously struck.<sup>9</sup>
- <strong>Forced Evacuations as War Crimes:</strong> Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, large‑scale displacement of civilians for reasons unrelated to their security or imperative military necessity is a grave breach. The continual push‑pull of residents across bombed corridors meets this threshold.  

- <strong>Plausible Deniability as Core Motive:</strong> The pattern of issuing warnings that lead civilians into freshly targeted zones suggests a strategic use of "precautions" to shield Israel diplomatically. By demonstrating formal compliance—broadcasting SMS alerts, dropping leaflets, publishing evacuation maps—Israeli officials can cite "best efforts" when questioned by the United States and other Western allies. This façade allows partner governments to maintain political support and arms transfers while deflecting legal scrutiny, even as the warnings themselves fail to provide real safety on the ground.

## human_shields
### "Hamas uses human shields"

#### Why This Claim Is False:

This claim is made by Israel's defenders to justify the Israeli military's killing of thousands of civilians in Gaza. Israel has repeatedly alleged that Hamas hides behind civilians, <strong>yet UN investigators and major rights organisations say they have not verified those claims, while abundant evidence shows Israeli forces coercing Palestinians to serve as shields.</strong> Moreover, Additional Protocol I makes it explicit that shielding civilians never strips them of protection:

> "Violations of these prohibitions shall not release the Parties to the conflict from their legal obligations with respect to the civilian population and civilian objects." — API, Art. 51 (7)–(8)<sup>1</sup>

ICRC Customary Rule 97 repeats the point: even when the enemy unlawfully places civilians at risk, the attacker "remains bound by the rules on distinction, proportionality and precautions." 

Therefore, if Hamas did use human shields the IDF would still be prohibited from launching any strike expected to kill, injure, or terrorise those civilians excessively in relation to the concrete military advantage anticipated. The responsibility for shielded civilians' deaths would rest with Israel if it chose weapons or tactics that violated those limits; the presence of shields cannot be invoked as a legal waiver under international humanitarian law.

#### Evidence Contradicting the Claim

- <strong>Lack of Proof for Hamas Human Shields:</strong> Amnesty International, monitoring the 2014 Gaza war and again during the 2023‑25 hostilities, stated it "does not have evidence … that Palestinian civilians have been intentionally used by Hamas or Palestinian armed groups … as 'human shields'."<sup>2</sup>
- <strong>UN Findings:</strong> The UN Commission of Inquiry's 12 June 2024 report said Israel "provided no evidence to substantiate its allegations that Palestinian armed groups systematically used civilians as human shields in Gaza."<sup>3</sup>
- <strong>Historical Pattern:</strong> Amnesty International's 2009 *Cast Lead* report and Human Rights Watch reviews of the 2009 and 2014 wars likewise found no credible evidence of Hamas directing civilians to act as shields. The report noted:<sup>4</sup>

    > "[Hamas] also mixed with the civilian population, although this would be difficult to avoid in the small and overcrowded Gaza Strip, and there is no evidence that they did so with the intent of shielding themselves. The extremely high population density in Gaza, a small territory and one of the most densely populated places in the world, entails additional challenges for all the parties involved in conflict or armed confrontations."
    The same document details several cases where <strong>the IDF used Palestinians as human shields</strong>.
- <strong>Documented Israeli Use Instead:</strong> An Associated Press investigation (June 2025) found Israeli troops "systematically forcing Palestinians to act as human shields," a practice soldiers called the "mosquito protocol."<sup>5</sup>
- <strong>Ineffectiveness of Palestinians as 'shields':</strong> A human shield tactic works only if the attacker is deterred from striking; yet Israel has carried out operations that have killed more than 35,000 civilians—about 70% women and children (UN OHCHR)—destroyed roughly 60% of Gaza's housing and displaced 90% of the population (UNRWA). A civilian group the IDF has shown it is willing to harm and kill in such numbers cannot function as a meaningful shield.
- <strong>Legal Reality:</strong> Even if Palestinian fighters ever used human shields, Israel would still be bound by distinction and proportionality; Human Rights Watch stresses that alleged shield use "does not permit indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks on those civilians."

## started
### "Palestinians started the war"

#### Why This Claim Is False:

<strong>The primary driver of armed resistance is Israel's continuing occupation, declared contrary to international law by the UN Security Council (Res. 242 & 338) and by the International Court of Justice in its 2004 Wall Advisory Opinion.</strong> Hamas did not appear until 1987—two decades after Israel seized Gaza and the West Bank—so its very existence, and the 7 Oct 2023 attacks, are consequences of that occupation, not its cause.<sup>1,2,3</sup>  Blaming Palestinians for "starting" the war erases fifty‑plus years of Israeli military control, settlement expansion, blockade, and large‑scale assaults on Gaza (2008‑09, 2012, 2014, 2021).

#### International‑Law Context

- <strong>Occupation Pre‑dates Hamas:</strong> Israel captured Gaza and the West Bank in June 1967; the UN has never recognised any Israeli sovereignty there.  The occupation, and the denial of Palestinian self‑determination, constitute the standing "first use of force."
- <strong>Illegal Blockade:</strong> The 16‑year land‑sea‑air closure, condemned by senior UN officials as "collective punishment," is itself an ongoing act of war.<sup>4</sup>
- <strong>Proportionality and Distinction Obligations:</strong> Even if Hamas initiated the latest hostilities, Israel remains bound by the Fourth Geneva Convention and Additional Protocol I, which forbid attacks expected to cause excessive civilian harm or to target civilian objects.

<strong>No reading of the laws of war permits an occupying power to reply to resistance with indiscriminate bombing, mass displacement, or large‑scale destruction of civilian infrastructure.</strong> The claim that "Palestinians started the war" is therefore both historically misleading and legally irrelevant.

## hostages
### "Just surrender and release the hostages"

#### Why The Implication Is Misleading

<strong>The slogan assumes Israel's assault would cease if Hamas freed the captives, yet military operations, siege, and occupation long pre‑date 7 Oct 2023 and Israeli leadership now ties the end of the war to a radically different objective: emptying Gaza of Palestinians.</strong>

#### Context Prior to 7 Oct 2023

- **Decades of Occupation and Blockade:** Israel has controlled Gaza since 1967 and enforced a land‑sea‑air closure since 2007, which the UN labels "cruel collective punishment."<sup>1</sup>  
- **Recurrent Assaults:** Major Israeli offensives in 2008‑09, 2012, 2014, and 2021 killed thousands of Palestinians, including 67 children in eleven days in May 2021.<sup>2</sup>

#### Hostage Deals Rejected

- **February 2024:** Hamas offered a cease‑fire‑for‑hostages swap; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the proposal "delusional."<sup>3</sup>  
- **January 2024:** Netanyahu rejected another deal that would have freed all remaining captives, insisting on "total victory."<sup>4</sup>

#### Netanyahu's Explicit End‑Game

- **Condition for Ending the War:** On 7 July 2025 Netanyahu told Israeli media he would not agree to a permanent cease‑fire until the "Trump relocation plan" was implemented—i.e., the permanent removal of Gaza's entire Palestinian population.<sup>5</sup>  This makes hostage release irrelevant to Israel's stated war‑termination criteria.

#### Bottom Line

Netanyahu's behaviour and statements confirm that Israel's primary objective is ethnic cleansing, not freeing hostages or defeating Hamas. The "just surrender" slogan weaponizes the hostages to blame Palestinian obstinacy for the bloodshed, masking Israel's effort to depopulate Gaza—a campaign that threatens Palestinians with national extinction.
